Here I will summarize some qualitative and quantitative comparisons
between the various discrete and continuous approximations we have used here.

RUNTIMES
for my computer - good specs, but should give a good feel of relative speed 
of calculation between functions. I give approximate average runtimes here in terms of
seconds per slit pixel per million wall pixels

discrete
-- sea -- 0.67
-- taylor --  0.82
-- exact -- 0.86

continuous
-- taylor -- 3.9
-- fraunhofer -- 1.0

In general these functions all run in constant time per slit pixel per wall pixel.
That is, if we have n slit pixels for an N x M wall, this program is O(nNM)

QUALITATIVE

I will just provide overall thoughts here based on the images provided in the 
images folder. 

The small equal angle approximation is definitely the worst overall. No significant 
benefits brought by speed given the extremely low accuracy. I will be ignoring 
this approximation for coming comparisons. 

The exact discrete and taylor discrete approximations are nearly indistinguishable in both 
results and runtimes. They are also quite accurate, barring the lack of interference for a single-pixel slit.

The fraunhofer integral approximation provides good time comparable to the above discrete approximations, 
and it interferes for a single-pixel slit. However, it strangely centers the image for an off-center slit,
and does not match with other approximations for multi-pixel slit configurations. 

The continuous taylor approximation is heavy on runtime, but provides highly accurate diffraction patterns,
matching the exact discrete and taylor discrete approximations for multi-pixel configurations, and correctly
interfering for a single-pixel slit.
